Make a temperature and humidity network sensors with a Raspberry pi and arduinos.

The pi is the command centre. It listens to the serial port of the master arduino.

Several slaves Arduino can be connected to the master arduino via RS485 te read the data. For
the current version, only one slave is used.

The current sensors used are DHT22 temperature and humidity. It is easy to use other sensor
 having arduino libraries.
